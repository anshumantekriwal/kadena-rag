Our commitment is to build in public, sharing daily details about our work, including partnerships, projects, and tools.\n\nShifting away from traditional announcement models, we've embraced what we call the 'Marvel Universe model', openly outlining our ongoing projects and keeping everyone updated on their progress. We understand the pitfalls of unrealistic launch dates, which can lead to failure either through missed deadlines or rushed subpar products. To set ourselves up for success, our focus is on transparency and launching products only when they are fully ready.\n\nOur roadmap is a modular one. Anyone in the community can use the following Figma file to create their own version of a roadmap and use it on their socials.\n\nFind the roadmap here: https://www.kadena.io/roadmap",

    "content": "How to Mine KDA | Mining KDA / Kadena\nThere's three primary ways:\n\n1) Find and buy your own ASIC miner, either buy directly from a seller like Bitmain and then plug it in at your house to a 240V power source, choose a mining pool, and set your ASIC to start mining\n\n2) Choose a hosting provider to host your ASIC for you. You buy the asic and send it to your hosting provider, they charge you for electricity, make sure it keeps running, and you get the mining rewards\n\n3) Chips.finance lets you simply pay for an ASIC, pay for hosting, and you can start mining right away.\n\nQ: What is CHIPS?\nA: CHIPS is an innovative tokenised real world assets (RWA) DeFi project with a focus on generating yield from proof-of-work (PoW) crypto mining and separately tokenised energy built on the Kadena blockchain.\nTo find out more you can read this Medium article by Chips' CTO Jad for an intro to CHIPS https://medium.com/@todd_chips/welcome-to-chips-revolutionizing-cryptocurrency-mining-7eabec03cdb4 or you can watch the video here if you prefer a video https://chips-1.gitbook.io/chips.finance-documentation\nFor further details please read our full project white paper on the website https://phoenixforgeusa.com/chips",
